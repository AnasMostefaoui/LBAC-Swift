 # Chapter II: Expression Parsing
 ## Part 3: Using the Stack / Multiplication and Division
 
 So far, we have been using only wo registers for storing terms.
 It works fine when we are doing `3-2` but what if we want to do something like
 
 ```
 1+(2-(3+(4-5)))
 ```

 To solve this, we will use the **CPU stack** in order to store many variables.
 
 This is a NEARLY functional parser/translator! The output is starting to look like something real ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

 ### term()
 You know how when you are given an expression like
 ```
 2 + 3 * 4
 ```
 you are supposed to multiply first and then add?
 
 In the past, people used really complex methods to make this happen but turns out, it's really easy to insure operator precedence rules with our top-down parsing technique!
 
 Until now, we have defined a `term` to be a single number. But we are going to define a `term` as a **PRODUCT OF FACTORS**.
 
 > `factor` is what term used to be, a single digit.
 > Also, notice how `term` looks almost identical to `expression`.
