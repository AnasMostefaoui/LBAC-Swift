 # LET'S BUILD A COMPILER 
 
 Welcome to LBaC (in Swift)!
 
 In the following series of Playgrounds, we will attempt to go through
 Jack W. Crenshaw's famous book in order to build a working compiler.
 
 The code provided here is the **minimal boiler plate code** we need to
 immediately get started on building a compiler.
 It consists of basic I/O, error, and other handling routines that don't need much attention for now.
 However, as we develop other routines, we will add them to the cradle until we get
 to a fully working compiler!!
 
 So, get excited and let's get started ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

 # The Lookahead Buffer
 */
/*:
 In the original LBaC, a single char `Look` is used as a global lookahead character
 that reads from the `stdin` in order to organize the scanning activites of a parser.
 
 But since we are in Playground and have no easy access to `stdin`, we will
 use a static string `input` that emulates user input to the parser.
 And as we process each character, `idx` and `cur` will be used to keep track 
 of where in `input` we are.

 `initialize()` serves to "prime the pump" by reading the
 first character from `input`. It uses the `Buffer` struct's `getChar()`.

 This is the one thing you should be worried about in this chapter!
