This repo is an attempt to learn how compilers work by translating Jack W. Crenshaw's [Let's Build a Compiler](http://www.compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/) book into Swift Playgrounds.

## üó∫Ô∏è How to Navigate
The original book is divided into 16 chapters and if you haven't noticed already, there are also 16 Playground files in this repo. 

**Each Playground file represents a chapter in the book**. However, because fitting an entire chapter into a single Playground file would be impractical, each chapter has been divided into several "Parts".

### .playground Structure

A `.playground` file is actually composed of *three* directories.

1. `Parts`  - individual parts of a book resides in
2. `Sources` - `Cradle.swift`, which contains all the boilerplate code used throughout the book is contained here
3. `Resource` - the original LBaC text file `tutor(n).txt` , is contained here

> If you can't seem to find these directories after opening your `.playground` file, press `‚åò + 0` to show the Navigator (left panel).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- The original Let's Build a Compiler (LBaC) was written in Turbo Pascal, a very popular language at the time. Pascal is very different from Swift and because of this, "literally" converting Pascal code into Swift is quite unnatural.
- To make the code as "Swifty" as possible, I have taken the liberty to make some changes in the code. Please feel free to offer suggestions on making the code even "Swifty-er"
- This has turned out to be more time consuming than I have imagined in the beginning. Therefore, **out of the 16 chapters, 10 have been completed so far**; feel free to continue on from where I have left off üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
