 # Chapter IX: A Top View
 ## Part 6: C
 
 The big problem with C is that first two parts of the declaration for data and functions can be the same.
 
 ```c
 int this_is_a_var ...
 int this_is_a_func ...
 ```
 
 Because of this, we can't use our original recursive-descent parser method on it. But we can adapt and change it into something that can work here.

 ### prog()
 
 The trick we will use to solve the conundrum is this...
 
 > We will build a parsing routine for class and type definitions and have them store away their findings, **all without knowing wheter a function or a data declaration is being processed.**
 
 Notice that all three functions are dummy functions that call `getChar()`

 There is nothing interesting going on here.
