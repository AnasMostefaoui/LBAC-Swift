 ## Part 4: Statements
 We will be `statements()` but here's something to ðŸ¤” about.
 
 We have been adding functions but the output of the program hasn't changed. And it's the way it's supposed to be.
 
 This high in the levels - *remember we are going from high to low now* - we don't need to emit code. The recognizers' job is to just recognize. They accept lines, catch bad ones and channel good ones to the right place.

 Grammatically, statements can begin with any identifier except `END`. It can also be represented like this
 ```
 BEGIN
 <statement>;
 END

 First semi-dummy version of `statement()` can be written like this.

 ## Intermission
 
 At this point, we could have to expanded `statements()` in order to make the compiler somewhat useful. The expansion would include things like `if/case/while/for` statements.
 
 But since we have already gone through this process of parsing assignment and control structures in previous chapters, we won't do it again. But do you see how **this is where the top level meets our old bottom-up approach? **The constructs will be little different now but the differences will probably be very minor.
 
 > So, **we will now stop trying to write a Pascal compiler.** Instead, we will now spend time making a **C Compiler**. Say whuuuutttt ðŸ¤¨
