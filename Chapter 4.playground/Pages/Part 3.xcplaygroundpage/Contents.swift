 ## A Little Philosophy ðŸ“–

 In the early days of compiler technology, people really stuggled trying to
 deal with things like opeartor precedence. People used 1, 2, 3 stacks with
 compiler precedence values that needed to be compared which then envolved more
 complicated steps. Other methods include using a parse tree, which is favored
 by many compiler textbooks.
 
 Anyways, we are doing similar things in our interpreter but we didn't use any stacks or trees.
 So, where are the stacks and the trees?
 
 **The answer is that the structures are implicit, not explicit.**
 
 Everytime Swift calls a `term()`, `expression()` or any subroutine, the return address is
 pushed onto the CPU stack. At the end, it's popped off and control is transferred.
 
 In other words, everything has been so simple because we have been using the resources
 provided by the language. Trees and stacks are all there but just hidden behind all the
 recursives calls made within Swift.
 
 ## TL;DR
